**Overview**
------------

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to recognize IoT gestures from acceleration and gyroscope data. The code is designed to work with a dataset of 8 different gestures, each with 600 data points.

**Dataset**
-----------

The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing acceleration and gyroscope data for 8 different gestures. The dataset is normalized and split into training and testing sets.

**Methodology**
--------------

1. Data preprocessing: The dataset is normalized using the `normalize` function from the `sklearn.preprocessing` module.
2. Data splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from the `sklearn.model_selection` module.
3. Model creation: A neural network model is created using the `tf.keras.models.Sequential` class.
4. Model training: The model is trained on the training set using the `fit` method.
5. Model evaluation: The model is evaluated on the testing set using the `evaluate` method.

**Code Structure**
-----------------

The code is organized into the following sections:

1. Importing necessary libraries
2. Loading and preprocessing the dataset
3. Creating and training the model
4. Evaluating the model
5. Visualizing the results

**Requirements**
--------------

* Python 3.11
* TensorFlow 2.11
* Keras 2.11
* Scikit-learn 1.1.2
* Pandas 1.5.2
* NumPy 1.23.5

**Getting Started**
-------------------

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/iot_gesture.git`
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the code using `jupyter notebook iot_gesture.ipynb`

Note: Make sure to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.
